# awApi

athenaWell JavaScript API

This module allows access to the athenaWell platform API via JavaScript. It also includes TypeScript definitions for importing into a TypeScript project.

## Versions
Versions of the API may need to be referenced using prerelease tags during development. E.g. `1.0.0-alpha.1` or `1.0.0-beta.1`.

## Example Usage
`package.json`

    {
        '@athena/aw-api': '1.0.0-alpha.1'
    }

`npm install`

If you are working with a local copy of the repo, use:

`package.json`

    {
        '@athena/aw-api': 'file:../aw-api'
    }


### Registry Details
If you don't already have an updated .npmrc in your user folder, add the following lines to be able to acces the athena-scoped projects

    registry=https://artifactory.aws.athenahealth.com:443/api/npm/npm/
    @athena:registry=https://artifactory.aws.athenahealth.com:443/api/npm/npm-local/


Import into the project.
```javascript
    import { User as UserClass } from '@athena/aw-api';

    ...

    let User = new UserClass('https://testapi.patientio.com/');
    User.GetSponsorUserAsync({
        distributorId: distributor_id,
        sponsorId: sponsor_id,
        userId: user_id,
        authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`
    }).then((response) => {
        console.log(response);
        ...
    });
```
You will need to authenticate and get an access_token via another means at this time.
